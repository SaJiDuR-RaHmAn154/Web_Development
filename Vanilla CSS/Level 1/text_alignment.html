      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and
      received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his
      creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the
      Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
      individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since
      the character's creation

    <h2>Publication History</h2>
    <p>
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters. During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in designing an unlikeable character and making him likeable.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
      Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many
      of whom criticized the character for his association with the United
      States military and the controversial Vietnam War.[4][26] In response,
      Marvel rewrote the character to moderate his image and to have him
      directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by war.[28][123]
      According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail
      from female readers, which he attributed to both the character's charisma
      and his tragic nature.[209]
