-------Everything in this will work in terminal,Git Bash and VSCode terminal similarly--------

-Terminal is a text input and output environment.
-It is efficient way,saves time and give access to hidden files of a pc to the programmers

-Command Line (windows centric texual command environment)
-Terminal (mac ceentric)
-Console (command line interface)
-Shell (a programe runninng on terminal)
-Bash
-Z-cell(mac os er pre-installed shell)

-For windows,We will use Git Bash to operate terminal commands

-Directory==Folder
-'~' (sign denotes home directory)
- up,down keys are used to see previous and new commands respectively

Commands
---------
(Basic):
--------
1. clear - clears the current terminal screen
2. pwd (print working directory) - depicts current working directory
3. ls (list files) - show all files of the current directory

Navigation:(inside and outside directories)
-----------
1.cd folderName (change directory) - Kono directory er vitorer folder a jete chaile
2.cd .. (back from the current directory) - .. denotes back button for terminal
3.cd Tab-key (gives suggestion)
4.cd Desktop/Cp(a whole directory) - it will direct you to that valid directory,if the file
 doesn't exists,then command won't execute
5.cd ../.. (2steps pisone chole asbe direct)
  similary jotobar .. dibo toto step pisone asbe


-Paths-(Relative,Absolute)
-Relative path name diye suru hoy(Depends on current working directory)(cd Desktop/Cp)
-Absolute path '/' diye suru hoy (cd /c/Users/ASUS/Desktop/Cp)

- cd '/' = root directoy
- cd '~' = home directory

Making Directories:
-------------------
1. mkdir = make directory(Creates folder)
   mkdir folderName - (to create new folder)
   Ex- mkdir Desktop/NewDir/Hello (Using relative path)
       mkdir /c/Users/ASUS/Desktop/NewDir/Hello/abc (using absolute path)


Flags: are characters that we pass with the commands to modify their behaviour
------
Manual Command: (Provides the working manual of a command)
---------------
man ls
man mkdir

-l,-p,-a etc are flags used with commands

N.B: man command is not working for Git Bash.So, use ls/mkdir --help instead or Normal Terminal
---- press 'Q' to leave the manual screen.

ls -a (shows hidden files in home directory)
ls -l (shows informations with folders)

Touch Command: (used to create files in a directory)
--------------
check-  (touch --help) for more information

1. touch fileName (at first cd to that directory.Then create file)

Delete Files and Folder: (deleted files will be removed permanently.Won't store in recycle bin)
------------------------
rm - remove files (rm fileName)
rmdir - remove empty folders(Empty thakte hobe directory)
rm-rf - remove any folders (folder er vitore file thakleo sob delete hoye jabe)

rf - refers to recursive force (rf duita flag aksathe use hoise)
